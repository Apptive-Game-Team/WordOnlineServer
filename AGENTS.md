# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository is a Gradle-based Spring Boot server targeting Java 21. Application code lives under `src/main/java/com/wordonline/server`, organized by feature areas such as `auth`, `session`, `game`, `deck`, `debug`, and `server`. Runtime configuration lives in `src/main/resources`. Test support files currently live in `src/test/resources`; add Java tests under `src/test/java` using the same package structure as the code under test.
For cross-repo context, see [related-repositories.md](air-file://g9ubn80st39rtru4viru/Users/jeong-yunseong/development/word-online/dev/game-server/docs/related-repositories.md?type=file&root=%252F).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `./gradlew build`: compile, run tests, and assemble the app.
- `./gradlew test`: run the JUnit test suite only.
- `./gradlew bootRun`: start the server locally with Spring Boot.
- `java -jar build/libs/*.jar`: run the packaged application after a build.
- `./deploy.sh` or `./remote-deploy.sh`: deploy using the project scripts.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use 4-space indentation and keep files in standard Java package layout. Follow existing naming patterns: `*Controller`, `*Service`, `*Repository`, `*Dto`, `*PrefabInitializer`, and `*System`. Classes use `PascalCase`, methods and fields use `camelCase`, and constants use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. Prefer the helper methods already present on domain objects, such as `addComponent(...)` and `addCollider(...)`, instead of mutating internal lists directly. Lombok is used widely; keep annotations consistent with surrounding code.

### Configuration values

Do not inject individual settings with `@Value`. Group related settings into one `@ConfigurationProperties` class and constructor-inject that object, so the values are type-safe, discoverable in one place, and injectable into tests without reflection.

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "server")
public record ServerIdentityProperties(String protocol, String domain, Integer externalPort) {}
```

Register properties classes with `@ConfigurationPropertiesScan` on the application class. Define each default in one place. Annotation arguments that require a string literal, such as `@Scheduled(fixedDelayString = "${...}")`, are the only exception. Existing `@Value` usage inside the scope you are already changing moves to a properties object; do not bulk-refactor beyond that scope.

## Testing Guidelines
The project uses `spring-boot-starter-test`, JUnit Platform, Spring Security test support, Awaitility, and H2 for test data. Put unit and integration tests in `src/test/java`, and name them `*Test` or `*IntegrationTest`. Reuse `src/test/resources/application.yml`, `schema-h2.sql`, and `data-h2.sql` for database-backed tests. Run `./gradlew test` before opening a PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Match the recent commit style: short imperative subjects with an optional scope, for example `refactor(component): use addComponent helper` or `feature(deactivebot)`. Keep commits focused on one concern. PRs should include a clear summary, linked issue or task, test notes, and any API or gameplay impact. For protocol, DTO, or debug-visual changes, include sample payloads or screenshots when helpful.
Name issue branches with the pattern `<issue-label>/<issue-number>`, for example `feature/253`. When no issue covers the work yet, create the issue before you create the branch: the branch name's number and prefix both come from it. Never open a branch named after the change instead of the issue.

Every issue and pull request must set an assignee and a label. Do not leave either blank.

- Assignee: `--assignee @me`.
- Label: use the same value as the branch prefix, so branch `feature/253` carries label `feature`. Check the available labels with `gh label list`; this repo has `feature`, `fix`, `refactor`, `documentation`, and `bug`. Do not invent new labels — ask when none of them fit.
- Do not attach a project.

```bash
gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --assignee @me --label feature
gh pr create --base <base> --title "..." --body "..." --assignee @me --label feature
```

Confirm both landed with `gh issue view <n> --json assignees,labels` after creating.

## Configuration & Cleanup
Do not commit secrets from `.env` or environment-specific values from `application.yml`. Keep generated files and local artifacts out of git; remove stray files such as `.DS_Store` before committing.

## Versioning

`version` in `build.gradle` is the game server's single version source.
Do not bump it in a pull request. The monorepo `deploy` skill bumps it once per
promotion: it commits `chore(release): WordOnlineServer vX.Y.Z` to `main`, merges
`main` into `deploy`, then tags and releases `vX.Y.Z` on the merge commit. The level comes
from the Conventional Commit messages promoted in that release: MAJOR for a `!`
marker or a `BREAKING CHANGE` trailer, MINOR for `feat:`, PATCH otherwise, so
write accurate commit types.

Never add a second runtime version or use a `-SNAPSHOT` deployable version.
Spring Boot build info embeds this value, and game statistics persist it as
`server_version`.

## Summoning Magics

A magic that leaves a lasting body on the field implements
`ObjectSummoningMagic`, returning the prefab it puts down and how many of it one
cast produces. The summoning families (`AbstractSpawnMagic`,
`AbstractSummonMagic`) already do, so a magic extending them inherits it; a new
family that spawns objects on its own has to declare it.

This is what lets the bot price a board it did not build. The hospitality bot in
particular may only summon while its own board stays under a share of the
player's, and mana spent is how that share is measured. The share is the
player's own `users.novice_progress`, read per session: the same bot faces
players at different points in the tutorial and must not treat them alike.

Do not reintroduce the link as data. Matching game objects to magics by name
does not work — `ember_spirit_swarm` summons `ember_spirit`, and most of what
stands on the field has no magic of its own name — and a column listing it would
be one more thing to forget when a unit is added. The magic that creates the
object is the only place that reliably knows it does, so the declaration lives
there.

A missing declaration has no loud symptom: those units price as free, the
hospitality bot reads the player's board as weaker than it is, and it plays
weaker than intended. Shots, drops and explosions deliberately do not implement
it — they are in flight rather than standing on the field.

## Database Changes

`../database/migration` is the source of truth for the shared game database.
Do not add production schema, seed, backfill, or gameplay data SQL under
`src/main/resources`. Add a new versioned Flyway migration in the database
repository and publish that commit before publishing game-server code that
depends on it. Test-only H2 fixtures remain under `src/test/resources`.
