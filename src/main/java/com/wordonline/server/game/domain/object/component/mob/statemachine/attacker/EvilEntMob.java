/**
 * A ranged damage dealer that fights with three separate extending arms.
 *
 * <p>The basic attack is a wooden arm punched out at range on the shared attack interval. On its
 * own longer cooldown the ent throws a second arm that hooks the victim and drags it inward, then
 * finishes with a third arm - a burning fist. All three arms are client-side visuals delivered as
 * projectiles; the server only owns the timing, the pull and the damage.
 *
 * <p>The burning fist is the payout for a drag that worked, never a hit the ent can collect on
 * its own. Anything too heavy to drag is never grabbed in the first place, and a grab that loses
 * its drag part way through lets go instead of finishing.
