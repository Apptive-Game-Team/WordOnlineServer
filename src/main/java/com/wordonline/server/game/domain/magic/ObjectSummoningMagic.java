/**
 * A magic that leaves lasting bodies on the field, and what it leaves.
 *
 * <p>The bot needs to price a board it did not build: to stay weaker than the player, the
 * hospitality bot has to know what the player's units cost to summon. The only honest source for
 * "which magic produces this prefab" is the magic that produces it, so the link is declared here
 * rather than kept as data beside the objects. A name match does not work - {@code
 * ember_spirit_swarm} puts down {@code ember_spirit} - and a hand-maintained column would be one
 * more thing to forget when a unit is added.
 *
 * <p>Implemented by the summoning families only. Shots, drops and explosions create objects too,
 * but those are in flight rather than standing on the field, and counting them as board presence
 * would price a passing projectile like a unit.
